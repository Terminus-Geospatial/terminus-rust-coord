#  Terminus Rust Coordinate API

This is an attempt to capture the capabilities of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's GEOTRANS library into a native Rust implementation. 

This library is provided an MIT license.  This is important as I have much respect for GEOTRANS and want it to live on, even if I don't.  This API seeks to model their algorithms as closely as possible.
